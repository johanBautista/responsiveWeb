        <h3>1. Tests, tests and more tests.</h3>
        <p>
          The World Health Organization (WHO) and experts consulted by BBC Mundo
          agree that early detection of cases is a fundamental factor in
          containing the spread of the pandemic. "We cannot take action or know
          the real impact of the virus if we do not know the people affected,"
          says Nyenswah.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Isolate the infected</h3>
        <p>
          Johnson notes that conducting tests not only isolates the sick and
          prevents the virus from spreading among more people, but also opens up
          the possibility of detecting possible infections that have not yet
          developed symptoms. "South Korea and China have done excellent work in
          tracing, testing, and containing their citizens," he says. According
          to the expert, the Beijing government has been "hypervigilant" in
          detecting new potential cases, which could be one of the causes behind
          the drop in infections they have reported.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Preparation and fast reaction</h3>
        <p>
          According to Nyenswah, who was one of the people responsible for the
          fight against Ebola in West Africa, one of the basic elements for the
          containment of a virus is to react quickly before the contagions
          spread among the population. "Countries like Taiwan and Singapore
          showed that rapid action for the detection and isolation of new cases
          can be a decisive factor in containing the spread," he says. An
          article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association
          on the response from Taiwan suggests that the containment the island
          has achieved partially responds to the preparation they have developed
          for eventual events of this type since they created a central command
          for control in 2003 of epidemics.
        </p>
        <h3>4. Social distancing</h3>
        <p>
          According to Nyenswah, when the first contagions of a new virus are
          reported in a population, containment measures no longer make sense
          and others, such as social distancing, turn out to be more effective
          in preventing the most vulnerable sectors from contagion. "Once you
          already have the disease in your country, containment measures are no
          longer valid. You have to start taking the right steps or you lose the
          possibility of effectively stopping the outbreak," he says. According
          to the expert, the speed in instructing norms of social distancing in
          nations such as Hong Kong and Taiwan was essential to reduce
          contagion.
        </p>
        <h3>5. Promote hygiene measures</h3>
        <p>
          Since the first outbreaks of coronavirus began to be reported outside
          of China, the WHO has insisted that in addition to social distancing,
          regular handwashing and hygiene when presenting any symptoms are
          essential to avoid transmission of the virus. "Many Asian countries
          learned from the SARS experience in 2003, and they are nations where
          there is an awareness of practicing hygiene measures not only to not
          get sick but not to infect others, which is essential in these cases,"
          says Nyenswah.
